# Forum Authentication

## Objectives

This project is a web forum with the following functionality:

- **Authentication**: Users can authenticate using Google, GitHub, or a traditional email/password method.
- **Communication between users**: Users can interact by creating posts and comments.
- **Image Upload**: Users can also interact by uploading images to the posts they are trying to make.
- **Categorization of posts**: Posts can be associated with one or more categories.
- **Likes and dislikes**: Users can like or dislike posts and comments, with the counts visible to everyone.
- **Filtering posts**: Posts can be filtered by categories, user-created posts, and liked posts.

## SQLite

SQLite is used to store the forum's data (e.g., users, posts, likes, dislikes, comments). It is an embedded database software ideal for local storage in application software.

### Notes:

SQLite enables creating and controlling a database using queries. To learn more about SQLite, visit the [SQLite documentation](https://sqlite.org/).

## Authentication

The forum supports user authentication through the following methods:




- **Registration**:
  - Users can register with a unique username and email.
  - A password is required during registration, and it is encrypted before storing.
  
- **Login**:
  - Users can log in using their email and password.
  - If the credentials are incorrect, an error response is returned.

### Sessions:

- User sessions are managed using **cookies** to keep users logged in.



## Communication

To facilitate communication among users:

- **Registered users**:
  - Can create posts and comments.
  - Posts can be associated with one or more categories (you decide the categories).
  
- **Non-registered users**:
  - Can only view posts and comments.

---

## Likes and Dislikes

- Only registered users can like or dislike posts and comments.
- The total number of likes and dislikes is visible to everyone (registered or not).

---

## Filter

The forum includes a filtering mechanism to:

- Filter posts by **categories** (like subforums for specific topics).
- Display posts created by the logged-in user (**created posts**).
- Display posts liked by the logged-in user (**liked posts**).



## Docker

**Docker** has been used to allow packaging the application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

To build the image:

```
docker build -t forum .
```

Then to run the built image:

```
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 forum
```
